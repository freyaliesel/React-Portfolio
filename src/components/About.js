                        Hi I'm Kit, and I'm an aspiring developer! I've spent my
                        life on computers, and it only makes sense to me that I
                        would take a crack at making a living programming
                        applications for them. I'm taking Northwestern
                        University's Coding Bootcamp in an effort to make a
                        career change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My professional history has seen me spend nearly two
                        decades in roles for various food service and retail
                        employers. During this time, I've volunteered in
                        managerial capacities for several non-profits and
                        religious organizations. Additionally, I own and
                        administrate a Discord server for a community comprising
                        over 17,000 members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a more personal level, I'm originally from Fairfax,
                        Virginia. I currently live in Chicago with my 11 year
                        old Sphynx cat, William, and he likes to yell at me
                        loudly while I do homework or try to relax. I spend my
                        free time playing video games, watching tv series with
                        my friends in a club we've had going for nearly two
                        years, and I recently started a Gloomhaven campaign!
